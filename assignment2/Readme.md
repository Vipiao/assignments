# Assignment 2

In this assignment you will be implementing your own decision trees. 

  * Build a **decision tree classifier** from the given training data set. Then, apply it on the test set and submit your predictions.
      - You need to build the decision tree classifier **from scratch**. (I.e., it is not allowed to use existing machine learning libraries or packages.)
      - You may use any programming language/environment of your choice, but you are required to submit the complete source code that produced your output.
      - The output (a single file with the predictions for each test instance) **must be generated automatically using the decision tree approach implemented by you**. Submitting predictions from any other source (Internet, another team, etc.) is considered cheating and will result in immediate disqualification (i.e., dismissal from the course).   
      - The predictions are also required to be submitted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/t/42fe17fac7d54895bb0181e85b4d4d19). **The team name for the submissions must be the GitHub username of the team leader**.
      - In order to pass this assignment, you need to reach an **Accuracy of at least 0.53** on the test set.
      - The best performing team (each team member) will get 5 bonus points at the final exam (which will be 100 points in total).
      - A skeleton of a possible implementation in Python for an example dataset is made available in [this notebook](2_Decision_tree_example.ipynb).
